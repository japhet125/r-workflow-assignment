## Overview

This project analyzes housing-related data obtained from NYC Open Data. The dataset includes
information on housing programs, population counts, and rental costs, and is used here to
demonstrate data loading and transformation in R.
Source: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/

## Data Transformation

The original NYC Open Data file contained a large number of demographic and housing-related
variables. To simplify downstream analysis, a subset of relevant columns was selected,
including program type, Section 8 status, total families, total population, and average gross rent.
Column names were also cleaned to improve readability and consistency.



## Conclusion

This analysis prepared a clean and reproducible subset of NYC housing data for future exploration.
Future work could examine relationships between housing programs, population size, and rental costs
or incorporate additional years of data for trend analysis.
