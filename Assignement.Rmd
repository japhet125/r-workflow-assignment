## Approach


For this project, I plan to work with a housing-related dataset from NYC Open Data that contains
information on housing programs, population counts, and rental costs. I will begin by identifying
a dataset that is relevant to understanding housing conditions in New York City and storing it in
a public GitHub repository to ensure reproducibility.

My approach will focus on loading the data directly from a public URL into R and then selecting
a meaningful subset of variables that are most useful for downstream analysis. I will clean and
rename columns to make them easier to interpret and consistent with standard naming conventions.
This transformed dataset will serve as a clean foundation for future exploratory analysis.

One anticipated challenge is that NYC Open Data files often contain many columns, inconsistent
naming conventions, or missing values. I may need to inspect the data structure carefully and
decide which variables are relevant and which can be safely removed. Another challenge may be
ensuring that all data types are correctly interpreted when importing the CSV file.

## Overview
housing-related data obtained from NYC Open Data. The dataset includes
information on housing programs, population counts, and rental costs, and is used here to
demonstrate data loading and transformation in R.

## Data Transformation

The original NYC Open Data file contained a large number of demographic and housing-related
variables. To simplify downstream analysis, a subset of relevant columns was selected,
including program type, Section 8 status, total families, total population, and average gross rent.
Column names were also cleaned to improve readability and consistency.

```{r}
dataset <- read.csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/japhet125/r-workflow-assignment/main/NYCHA_Resident_Data_Book_Summary_20260125.csv",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

head(dataset)
str(dataset)
colnames(dataset)
#selecting a subset of a column

subset_dataset = dataset[, c(
  "PROGRAM",
  "STATECITY_SECTION8_FLAG",
  "Total.Families",
  "Total.Population",
  "All.Average.Gross.Rent"
  
)]

head(subset_dataset)
#cleaning column names

colnames(subset_dataset) = c(
  "CITY_PROGRAM",
  "SECTION_8",
  "Total_Families",
  "Total_Population",
  "All_Average_Gross_Rent"
)
head(subset_dataset)

```

## Conclusion

This analysis prepared a clean and reproducible subset of NYC housing data for future exploration.
Future work could examine relationships between housing programs, population size, and rental costs
or incorporate additional years of data for trend analysis.
